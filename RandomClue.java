/**
 * RandomClue.java : Your job is to ask your AssistantJack and get the correct
 * answer in <= 20 tries.  RandomClue is ONE solution to the problem,
 * where a set of random numbers is generated every attempt until all three
 * random numbers match the solution from the AssistantJack object.
 *
 * This is a sample solution, a driver using random number implementation.
 * You can use this file as a guide to create your own SEPARATE driver for
 * your implementation that can solve it in <= 20 times consistently.
